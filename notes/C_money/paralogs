I realized I had to download cultures as well. Of the 101 marine cultures the authors used, I was able to download 38 from NCBI and use for downstream analysis.

Gotta run BLASTCLUST on proteins not CDS haha. Output is one line per cluster, just count lines and divide by CDS headers

I know I'm only using 38/101 cultures, but not convinced. For one, these aren't actually paralogs, just gene families defined by a low similarity threshold (%30 identical over %50 of length)
Looks from plot like trend is entirely explicable by genome size.

I downloaded an additional 20 marine cultures in order to see what's up. Of note these are not necessarily pelagic but pathogenic, sediments, etc. Got some cyanos and an annamox.
